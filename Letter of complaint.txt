Letter of complaint

Dear [name],
On January 30th, 2020, I made a reservation at your restaurant located at 1234 Mulberry Lane for a birthday dinner for four people. This letter is intended to bring certain issues to your attention.
Unfortunately, we did not enjoy our dinner due to the fact that the food was very slow to arrive and we received the wrong dishes. It’s understandable that it was a busy time at your restaurant, but the quality of the service was not as expected.
To resolve this problem, I would appreciate it if you could provide compensation in the form of a gift voucher or discount on a future meal. 
I’m looking forward to your reply.
With regards,
[Your name]
